    <p>
      Solgalao may have a ghost weakness, but he can learn crunch, a dark type move, wich is 4 times efective against Lunala!
      However since their speeds are exactly matched and it's not a one shot ko move it's not a garuntied win!

        I've done the calculation, and it seems that even with stab and Solgalaoes 2 times weakness to Lunala's moonghiestbeam it's not enough to one shot Solgalao! And like i've said they both have the same speed stats, it'll never be a garuntied win on ethier side, although Lunalas moonghiestbeam does do more damage, so that technically makes it the winner!<p>
