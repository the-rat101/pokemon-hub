        Garchomp vs mega Garchomp
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Garchomp
      </h3>
      <p>
        garchomp is quite a formidable pokemon thats stats totaly live up to its awsome apearance. With the dramatic speed loss that could very well cost Garchomp the game!
      </p>
      <h3>
      mega Garchomp
      </h3>
      <P>
       garchomp has exelant speed as we mentioned earlier but some pokemon out speed it! Those being Lycanerock, Archeops and minor just to name a few! But with mega Garchomp it gains a huge amount of defence to be able to bulk out those hits. Also if mega Garchomp had max ivs in speed attack and defence it would be unbeatable! Also if it gets down to low health it could have a salac berri equiped to raise its speed and dominate the rest of the game.</P>

      mega Metagross vs mega mega Lucario
      </h2>
      <h3>
      mega Metagross
      </h3>
      <p>
          Basically the battle is already over before its started! mega Metagross is a psycic type and would destroy Lucario with its psycic, right? Well actually no! Lucarios steel type prevents that! But Metagross can learn earthquack, why is this a big deal you may ask? Well because lucarios steel type meens it cant handle ground type moves!
      </p>
      <h3>
        mega Lucario
      </h3>
      <p>
       Well it might seem all is lost for Lucario but its not! and has focus punch, a stab move. And thanks to his unique ability, adaptability(wich means stab does 2 times the damage) although will that be enough to overcome mega Metagross?

        Solgalao vs Lunala
      </h2>
      
      <h3>
        Solgalao
      </h3>
      <p>
        And now is time for the ultiment rivalry of the ledgendary pokemon, Solgalao and Lunala!at first it seems there is no hope for Solgalao as he has a weakness to ghost type moves, and Lunalas main move(moonghiest beam) is a ghost type move and Lunala has stab! but Solgalao has a pretty decant move set, so can Solgalao overcome Lunalas moonghiest   beem or will Lunala take home the victory?
      </p>
      <h3>
        Lunala
      </h3>
      <p>
      These pokemons stats mirror each other, Solgalao has 137 attack and 107 deffence and Lunala has the same amount of special attack and special defence, plus they both have the same speed and hp. So it would seem that we have a fair fight, but no! Lunalas moonghiest beem would destroy Solgalao as it is super effective. But solgalao is not one to underestimate!</p>
