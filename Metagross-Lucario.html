      Basically the battle is already over before its started! mega Metagross is a psycic type and would destroy Lucario with its psycic, right? Well actually no! Lucarios steel type prevents that! But Metagross can learn earthquak, why is this a big deal you may ask? Well because lucarios steel type meens it cant handle ground type moves! I have done the damage calculation and it can 1 shot mega Lucario! Although mega Lucario has more speed than mega Metagross</p>

      Well it might seem all is lost for Lucario but its not! mega Lucario has 2 more speed than mega Metagross and has focus punch, a stab move. And thanks to his unique ability, adaptability(wich means stab does 2 times the damage) that means it can one shot mega Metagross and take home the victory! It was a tight one but mega Metagross is not likely to have earthquak anyway and focus punch is a graet move for mega Lucario to have plus he has damage calculation on his side!</P>
