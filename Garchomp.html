      <p>garchomp is quite a formidable pokemon thats stats totaly live up to its awsome apearance. This particular pokemon is quite frail but can hold its own against a strong opponant. It exeeds in attack, speed and even has a decent defence stat. So its mega must be even better, right? Whell most people say its mega was a huge fail as its speed stat actually lowers by 10! It's attack and defence are raised signifigantly but Garchomps speed is what makes him so gereat in battle. With the dramatic speed loss that could very well cost Garchomp the game!</p>

      <p>the last artical spent its entirety talking about how great Garchomp is and about how mega Garchomp is bad, but I disagree. garchomp has exelant speed as we mentioned earlier but some pokemon out speed it! Those being Lycanerock, Archeops and minor just to name a few! This proves that this pokemon is not completely relient on speed. Its defence is good but if a crit or super effective hit where to land it would take a decent chunk of Garchomps health. But with mega Garchomp it gains a huge amount of defence to be able to bulk out those hits. Also if mega Garchomp had max ivs in speed attack and defence it would be unbeatable! Also if it gets down to low health it could have a salac berri equiped to raise its speed and dominate the rest of the game. So thats why I think mega Garchomp tops regular Garchomp!
